# CAMCAL Documentation

Welcome to CAMCAL (the CAMera CALibrator... very clever.) This site contains usage information for the software and its corresponding hardware.

## Getting Acquainted

### The Main Window

This is the main CAMCAL window. Here are the key components:

1. **[Movement controls](#controlling-movement).** When connected (see [status](#device-statuses)), use these arrow keys to nudge the platform in a given direction. Hold them down to move continuously.
1. **[The viewer](#the-viewer).** Once a camera is selected (#3), the large brown rectangle will become a live feed of the axis being controlled below it. You can pan and zoom to get the best view possible.
1. **Device selection.** A place to select what camera to use. Make sure to assign the correct camera to each axis to avoid confusion.
1. **[Device Status](#device-statuses).** Where to monitor your connection with the system.

## Usage

### Device Statuses

This is where you can keep tabs on the status of the physical hardware. Some statuses are clickable&mdash;those ones are bold.

#### The options:

#### ![status click to connect](https://i.imgur.com/0iDCY3F.png)

What you'll see after opening the application. Click to begin the connecting process.

#### ![status connecting](https://i.imgur.com/B9FYCLK.png)

While CAMCAL is attempting to find the connection.

#### ![status connected](https://i.imgur.com/V6Ph7SV.png)

You're connected and all buttons are now enabled (so be careful!)

#### ![status connect timeout](https://i.imgur.com/OSkpH0q.png)

Connection failed. Feel free to try unplugging the USB and plugging it back in, then click on the status to try reconnecting. Need more help? See [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### Controlling Movement

### The Viewer

## Configuration

The app needs some configuration to run. The first time you run the application, it may ask you to configure it first. Any other time, you can reconfigure it by **right-clicking anywhere** in the app and **clicking "ðŸ›  Configure"**.
